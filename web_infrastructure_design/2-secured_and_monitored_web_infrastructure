- For every additional element, why you are adding it
	Firewalls to enforce security and control the flow of traffic between a private network and an outer network.
	SSL certificate to encrypte communication between network and an outer network.
	Monitoring clients are added to monitor system performance, availability, and security.

- What are firewalls for
Firewalls allow, limit, and block network traffic based on preconfigured rules in the hardware or software, analyzing data packets that request entry to the network.

- Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
With a HTTPS connection, all communications are securely encrypted. This means that even if somebody managed to break into the connection, they would not be able decrypt any of the data which passes between you and the website.

- What monitoring is used for
Will watch computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.

- How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Monitoring tools collect data using clients to gather information and analyzing network traffic to detect anomalies.

- Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
To monitor the QPS of a web server, we can set up monitor getting data input and output from the web server and analize in real time for raise an alert in the event of a problem.

- Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
SSL at the load balancer is an issue because all informations between load balancer and web server aren't encrypt.

- Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue because if this web server fails a SPOF will be raise.

- Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
Having servers with all the same components might be a problem if you need to effect a maintenance for one of components or one of these have a hardware issues, all components are affecting.
